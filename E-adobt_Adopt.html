          This unique-looking cat is the perfect pet for families with its active, playful, and goofy personality. It gets along with kids and other pets, and if you’ve ever owned a dog before, you’ll find its ‘dog-like’ temperament right up your alley. However, keep your windows shut and your balconies closed, as it’s not an outdoor cat.
          
          
          ‍
          
          The sphynx is also a fairly new breed. The first sphynx was born in Canada in 1966 and, thanks to a recessive gene causing hairlessness, it doesn’t shed much. For that reason, it’s generally considered hypoallergenic but often needs to be washed to remove oil build-up.
          
          If you love a good cuddle, you’re in luck! Since the sphynx doesn’t have hair, it’s cold all the time and needs to be protected from the elements. What better way to stay warm than to snuggle with its owner?
          
          ‍Weight: 8–10 pounds
          
          Lifespan: 15–20 years
